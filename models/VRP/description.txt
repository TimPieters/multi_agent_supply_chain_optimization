This is a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) optimization model.
The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by vehicles to serve all customers from a central depot.
Key parameters include:
- n_customers: The number of customer locations.
- vehicle_capacity: The maximum demand a single vehicle can serve.
- num_vehicles: The total number of vehicles available.
- demand: The demand at each customer location.
- distance: The matrix of travel distances between all locations.
- coords: The coordinates of each location.

Scenarios for sensitivity analysis might involve changing:
- Customer demands (e.g., increasing/decreasing specific demands or all demands).
- Vehicle capacity (e.g., reducing capacity to test feasibility).
- Number of available vehicles.
- Adding new constraints related to specific routes or customer assignments.
