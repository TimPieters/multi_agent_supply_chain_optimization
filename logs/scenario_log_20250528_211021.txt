--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes in vehicle capacity and customer demand have significant impacts on both the total cost and model feasibility. Reducing vehicle capacity consistently leads to increased costs and, in extreme cases, model infeasibility. Increasing customer demand also affects costs, but to a lesser extent compared to capacity changes. Increasing the number of vehicles did not significantly impact costs, indicating that the current vehicle count was sufficient to handle the demand efficiently.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity:**
   - Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 resulted in a significant cost increase (ΔObj: 26.3%).
   - Further reduction to 20 led to model infeasibility, highlighting the critical role of vehicle capacity in maintaining feasibility.

2. **Customer Demand:**
   - Increasing the demand of the most significant customer (customer 4) led to a moderate cost increase (ΔObj: 9.8%).
   - Increasing the demand of another significant customer (customer 5) did not affect costs, suggesting some demand changes are absorbed without cost impact.

3. **Number of Vehicles:**
   - Increasing the number of vehicles from 2 to 4 did not change the cost (ΔObj: 0.0%), indicating that the existing vehicle count was already optimal for the given demand.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 4:** Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 20 resulted in model infeasibility. This scenario is critical as it highlights the threshold at which the model can no longer find a feasible solution, emphasizing the importance of maintaining adequate vehicle capacity.
  
- **Scenario 1:** Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 caused the largest cost increase (ΔObj: 26.3%), demonstrating the sensitivity of the model to changes in vehicle capacity.

These scenarios underscore the importance of vehicle capacity in maintaining both cost efficiency and feasibility in the VRP model.

--- Scenario Log ---
1. Scenario: 'Reduce the vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 to test the feasibility and impact on total cost, given the current customer demands.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 416.89, ΔObj: 86.79 (26.3%)
2. Scenario: 'Increase the number of vehicles from 2 to 4 to assess how the added capacity affects total distance traveled and whether it leads to a significant reduction in costs or reveals new feasibility constraints.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
3. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of the most significant customer (customer 4 with a demand of 9) from 9 to 20 to test the feasibility and impact on total cost given the current vehicle capacity and number of vehicles.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 362.57, ΔObj: 32.47 (9.8%)
4. Scenario: 'Scenario: 'Decrease the vehicle capacity from 50 to 20 to assess the impact on total cost and test the feasibility under the current customer demands, especially given the higher demands from multiple customers.'' -> Error: Execution Result: Model Infeasible
5. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of the second most significant customer (customer 5 with a demand of 9) from 9 to 25 to test the feasibility and impact on total cost, considering the current vehicle capacity and number of vehicles.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
