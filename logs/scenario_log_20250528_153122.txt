--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis reveals that changes in vehicle capacity have the most significant impact on both the total cost and model feasibility. Reducing vehicle capacity consistently leads to increased costs and, in more severe reductions, results in model infeasibility. This indicates that vehicle capacity is a critical constraint in the VRP model. Conversely, increasing the number of vehicles does not impact the total cost, suggesting that the original number of vehicles was sufficient to meet demand efficiently. Reducing demand at specific customer locations decreases the total cost, highlighting the influence of demand distribution on routing efficiency.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity:**
   - Most impactful, as reductions in capacity lead to significant cost increases and infeasibility.
   - Example: Reducing capacity from 50 to 30 increased costs by 26.3%, and further reductions led to infeasibility.

2. **Demand Levels:**
   - Changes in demand at specific locations can decrease costs, indicating sensitivity to demand distribution.
   - Example: Reducing demand at locations 4 and 5 decreased costs by 10.3%.

3. **Number of Vehicles:**
   - Increasing the number of vehicles had no impact on cost, indicating low sensitivity in this scenario.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 3 and 5 (Infeasibility):** Reducing vehicle capacity to 20 and 10 led to model infeasibility, highlighting the critical role of capacity in maintaining feasibility.
- **Scenario 2 (Largest Cost Increase):** Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 resulted in the largest cost increase (26.3%), demonstrating the sensitivity of the model to capacity constraints.
- **Scenario 4 (Cost Decrease):** Reducing demand at specific locations led to a significant cost decrease (-10.3%), showing the impact of demand distribution on cost efficiency.
