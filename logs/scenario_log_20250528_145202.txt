--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals several key insights:

- **Vehicle Capacity Changes:** Reducing vehicle capacity had a significant impact on the total cost, increasing it by 26.3%. This indicates that vehicle capacity is a critical factor in maintaining cost efficiency.
  
- **Demand Increases:** Increasing customer demand, whether for high-demand or low-demand customers, resulted in noticeable cost increases (17.2% and 15.8%, respectively). This suggests that demand levels are sensitive parameters affecting the total cost.

- **Number of Vehicles:** Increasing the number of vehicles did not affect the total cost, indicating that the original number of vehicles was sufficient to meet demand without underutilization.

- **Increased Vehicle Capacity:** Increasing vehicle capacity led to a cost reduction of 10.3%, suggesting that larger vehicle capacities can improve routing efficiency and reduce costs.

Overall, changes in vehicle capacity and customer demand levels had the most significant impact on the model's cost efficiency.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity Changes:** Most impactful, with a 26.3% increase in cost when reduced and a 10.3% decrease when increased.
2. **Demand Levels:** Significant impact, with increases in demand leading to 17.2% and 15.8% cost increases.
3. **Number of Vehicles:** Minimal impact on cost, with no change observed when the number of vehicles was increased.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1 (Reduce Vehicle Capacity):** This scenario caused the largest cost increase (26.3%), highlighting the critical role of vehicle capacity in cost management.
  
- **Scenario 5 (Increase Vehicle Capacity):** This scenario resulted in a significant cost reduction (-10.3%), demonstrating the potential benefits of accommodating larger loads.

These scenarios underscore the importance of optimizing vehicle capacity to balance cost efficiency and service feasibility.

--- Scenario Log ---
1. Scenario: 'Reduce the vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 to test the feasibility of serving all customers with the available vehicles.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 416.89, ΔObj: 86.79 (26.3%)
2. Scenario: 'Increase the number of vehicles from 2 to 4 to assess the impact on total distance traveled and determine if it leads to a more optimal solution or increased costs due to underutilization.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
3. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of customer locations with the highest demand (customers 2, 4, and 10) by 50% to assess the impact on total cost and feasibility given the current vehicle capacity and number of vehicles.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 387.01, ΔObj: 56.91 (17.2%)
4. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of customer locations with the lowest demand (customers 0, 1, 5, and 7) by 100% to assess the impact on total cost and potential infeasibility given the current vehicle capacity and number of vehicles.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 382.11, ΔObj: 52.01 (15.8%)
5. Scenario: 'Increase the vehicle capacity from 50 to 70 to evaluate how accommodating larger loads affects the routing efficiency and overall costs, potentially leading to reduced total distance traveled or revealing new infeasibility issues with existing customer demands.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 296.26, ΔObj: -33.84 (-10.3%)
