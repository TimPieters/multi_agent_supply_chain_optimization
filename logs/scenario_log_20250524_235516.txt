--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The scenarios tested in the log primarily focus on limiting the capacities of various facilities. Each scenario resulted in an optimal solution, indicating that the model remained feasible despite the imposed capacity constraints. The changes in total cost (ΔObj) were relatively consistent across most scenarios, with a notable increase in cost when the capacity of facility 2 was limited to 20. This suggests that capacity constraints have a significant impact on the total cost, with some facilities being more critical than others.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Facility Capacities:** The scenarios demonstrate that limiting facility capacities consistently impacts the total cost. The most significant impact was observed when the capacity of facility 2 was limited, resulting in the highest percentage increase in cost (19.5%).

2. **Specific Facility Impact:** Among the facilities tested, facility 2's capacity limitation had the most substantial impact on the cost, indicating its critical role in the supply chain network.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 5:** 'Limit the capacity of facility 2 (index 1) to 20.' This scenario resulted in the highest cost increase (ΔObj: 71.57, 19.5%), highlighting the critical importance of facility 2's capacity in maintaining cost efficiency. This scenario is particularly revealing as it suggests that facility 2 is a bottleneck or a key node in the network, where capacity limitations significantly affect overall costs.

Overall, the analysis indicates that while capacity limitations generally increase costs, certain facilities, like facility 2, are more sensitive to such changes, making them critical points of focus for maintaining cost-effective operations.
