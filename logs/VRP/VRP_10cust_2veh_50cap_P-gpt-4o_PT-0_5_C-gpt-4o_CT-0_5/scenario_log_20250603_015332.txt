--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes in customer demand and vehicle capacity, as well as the introduction of new constraints, significantly impact both the total cost and model feasibility. Specifically, increasing customer demands often led to infeasibility, especially when combined with a reduction in the number of available vehicles or vehicle capacity. New constraints, such as mandatory rest periods or limits on travel distance per route, also contributed to increased costs and infeasibility in some scenarios.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Demand Levels:** Increasing customer demands, particularly when combined with other changes, frequently resulted in model infeasibility. This parameter had the most significant impact on both cost increases and feasibility.
   
2. **Number of Available Vehicles:** Reducing the number of vehicles often led to infeasibility, especially when paired with increased demands.

3. **Vehicle Capacity:** Lowering vehicle capacity contributed to infeasibility in scenarios with high demand increases.

4. **Specific Constraints:** Introducing new constraints, such as mandatory rest periods or travel distance limits, led to increased costs and, in some cases, infeasibility.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 2 and 3:** Both scenarios resulted in infeasibility due to a combination of increased demands and a reduction in the number of available vehicles, highlighting the critical impact of these parameters on model feasibility.

- **Scenario 6:** This scenario had the largest cost increase (ΔObj: 86.79, 26.3%) due to increased demands and the introduction of a mandatory rest period constraint, demonstrating the significant impact of new constraints on cost.

- **Scenario 5 and 9:** Both scenarios resulted in infeasibility due to increased demands and reduced vehicle capacity, underscoring the sensitivity of the model to these parameters.

Overall, the analysis indicates that demand levels and vehicle availability are the most sensitive parameters, with specific constraints also playing a crucial role in determining the feasibility and cost of the VRP model.
