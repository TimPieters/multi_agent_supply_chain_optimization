--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals several insights into how different changes impact the model's performance and feasibility:

- **Capacity Constraints:** Reducing vehicle capacity consistently resulted in significant cost increases and, in some cases, infeasibility. For instance, reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 35 led to a 22.5% increase in cost, indicating high sensitivity to capacity constraints.
  
- **Vehicle Availability:** Reducing the number of available vehicles from 2 to 1 resulted in model infeasibility, highlighting the critical role of vehicle availability in maintaining feasibility.

- **Demand Changes:** Increasing demand at specific locations or across all locations generally led to moderate cost increases. However, the model remained feasible, suggesting some resilience to demand fluctuations.

- **Distance Increases:** Increasing distances between specific locations resulted in a modest cost increase (3.5%), indicating that while distance changes affect costs, they are less impactful than capacity constraints.

- **Operational Constraints:** Introducing new operational constraints, such as limiting the number of customers served per trip, led to infeasibility, emphasizing the model's sensitivity to rigid operational rules.

- **Customer Location Changes:** Drastic changes in customer locations, such as halving the number of locations, resulted in a significant cost decrease (-48.6%), showing that the model is highly sensitive to the distribution of demand across the network.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity Constraints:** Most impactful, leading to significant cost increases and infeasibility.
2. **Vehicle Availability:** Critical for feasibility; reducing vehicles led to infeasibility.
3. **Operational Constraints:** Introducing rigid constraints often led to infeasibility.
4. **Demand Levels:** Moderate impact on cost, but generally maintained feasibility.
5. **Customer Location Changes:** Significant impact on cost, especially when drastically altering demand distribution.
6. **Distance Changes:** Least impactful on cost, with modest increases observed.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 2:** Reducing the number of vehicles from 2 to 1 caused infeasibility, highlighting the importance of vehicle availability.
  
- **Scenario 1 and 8:** Reducing vehicle capacity (from 50 to 35 and 40, respectively) led to a 22.5% increase in cost, showing high sensitivity to capacity constraints.

- **Scenario 9:** Halving the number of customer locations resulted in a significant cost decrease (-48.6%), revealing the model's sensitivity to changes in demand distribution.

- **Scenario 10:** Introducing a constraint limiting demand per trip led to infeasibility, indicating the model's sensitivity to operational constraints.
