--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes in demand levels and vehicle capacity constraints have the most significant impact on both the total cost and model feasibility. Specifically, increasing customer demands and reducing vehicle capacity consistently led to substantial increases in total cost. Additionally, reducing the number of available vehicles resulted in model infeasibility, indicating a critical dependency on vehicle availability to meet customer demands. Introducing specific route constraints had varied impacts, with some scenarios showing no change in cost, while others resulted in moderate cost increases.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity Constraints:**
   - Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 resulted in the highest cost increase (ΔObj: 26.3%).
   - This parameter change is highly sensitive as it directly affects the feasibility of serving customer demands.

2. **Demand Levels:**
   - Increasing demands at specific customer locations consistently led to significant cost increases, with the highest being a 22.5% increase when demands at locations 2 and 9 were increased.
   - Demand changes are critical as they directly impact vehicle load and routing efficiency.

3. **Number of Available Vehicles:**
   - Reducing the number of vehicles from 2 to 1 led to model infeasibility, highlighting the importance of vehicle availability in maintaining feasibility.

4. **Specific Route Constraints:**
   - Introducing constraints that limit vehicle routing flexibility had mixed impacts, with some scenarios showing no cost change and others resulting in moderate increases (up to 16.0%).

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1:** Reducing the number of available vehicles from 2 to 1 resulted in model infeasibility, indicating a critical dependency on vehicle availability.
- **Scenario 6:** Decreasing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 led to the largest cost increase (ΔObj: 26.3%), highlighting the sensitivity of the model to capacity constraints.
- **Scenarios 4 and 9:** Increasing demands at specific customer locations (e.g., locations 2 and 9) resulted in a significant cost increase of 22.5%, demonstrating the impact of demand changes on total cost.

These scenarios are particularly revealing as they underscore the critical parameters that influence the model's performance and feasibility.
