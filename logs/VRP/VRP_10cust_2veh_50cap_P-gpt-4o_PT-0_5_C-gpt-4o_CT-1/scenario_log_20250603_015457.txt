--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals several key insights:

- **Demand Increases:** Increasing customer demand, particularly at specific locations, consistently led to significant impacts on the total cost. For example, increasing demand at customer location 4 resulted in a 9.8% increase in cost, while increasing demand at multiple locations (5, 6, and 11) led to a 15.8% increase.
  
- **Vehicle Capacity and Availability:** Reducing vehicle capacity or the number of available vehicles often resulted in model infeasibility. This indicates a high sensitivity to these parameters, as the model could not find a feasible solution under these constraints.

- **Distance Reductions:** Simulating improved infrastructure by reducing distances between locations led to a notable decrease in total cost by 20%, highlighting the sensitivity of the model to transportation costs.

- **Specific Constraints:** Introducing specific routing constraints, such as requiring certain customers to be served consecutively or by separate vehicles, generally did not affect the total cost significantly but did impact feasibility in some cases.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity and Availability:** Changes in vehicle capacity and the number of vehicles had the most significant impact, often leading to infeasibility.
   
2. **Demand Levels:** Increases in demand, especially at multiple locations, resulted in substantial cost increases, indicating high sensitivity.

3. **Transportation Costs (Distance):** Reducing distances between locations had a significant impact on reducing total costs.

4. **Specific Constraints:** While some constraints did not affect cost, they impacted feasibility, indicating moderate sensitivity.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1 & 3:** Reducing the number of vehicles from 2 to 1 and reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 25 both led to infeasibility, highlighting the critical nature of vehicle-related parameters.

- **Scenario 6:** Reducing the distance between all locations by 20% resulted in the largest cost decrease (-20.0%), demonstrating the impact of transportation cost changes.

- **Scenario 8:** Increasing demand at multiple locations (5, 6, and 11) led to the largest cost increase (15.8%), underscoring the sensitivity to demand changes.

These scenarios provide valuable insights into the parameters that most significantly affect the VRP model's performance and feasibility.
