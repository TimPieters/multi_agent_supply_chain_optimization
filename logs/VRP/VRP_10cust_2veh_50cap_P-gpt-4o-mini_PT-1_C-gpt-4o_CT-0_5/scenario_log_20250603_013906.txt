--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes in vehicle capacity and customer demand levels have the most significant impact on total costs and model feasibility. Specifically, reducing vehicle capacity consistently leads to increased costs and, in one case, infeasibility. Increasing customer demands, particularly for high-demand customers, also results in substantial cost increases. Conversely, increasing the number of vehicles does not significantly affect costs, indicating potential overcapacity or redundancy.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity:**
   - Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 resulted in a 26.3% increase in costs.
   - Reducing vehicle capacity to 20 led to model infeasibility.
   - Increasing vehicle capacity from 50 to 70 decreased costs by 10.3%.

2. **Customer Demand Levels:**
   - Increasing demand for the highest-demand customer by 20 units increased costs by 15.8%.
   - Increasing demand for the second highest-demand customer by 25 units increased costs by 9.8%.
   - Increasing demand for the fifth highest-demand customer by 25 units and a 50% increase in total demand both resulted in a 22.5% increase in costs.

3. **Number of Vehicles:**
   - Increasing the number of vehicles from 2 to 4, 5, or 6 did not change costs, indicating redundancy or overcapacity.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 10:** Reducing vehicle capacity to 20 resulted in model infeasibility, highlighting the critical role of vehicle capacity in maintaining feasibility.
- **Scenario 1:** Decreasing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 led to the largest cost increase (26.3%), demonstrating the sensitivity of the model to capacity constraints.
- **Scenario 8:** A 50% increase in total customer demand resulted in a significant cost increase (22.5%), underscoring the impact of demand changes on routing efficiency and costs.

These scenarios emphasize the importance of maintaining adequate vehicle capacity and carefully managing customer demand levels to ensure cost-effective and feasible routing solutions.
