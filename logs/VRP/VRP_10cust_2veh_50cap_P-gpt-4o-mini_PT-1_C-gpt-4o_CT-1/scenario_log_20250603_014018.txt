--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes in vehicle capacity and the number of available vehicles have the most significant impact on model feasibility and total cost. Specifically, reducing vehicle capacity consistently led to infeasibility, indicating a critical dependency on adequate capacity to meet customer demands. Increasing customer demand also resulted in substantial cost increases, highlighting the sensitivity of the model to demand fluctuations. Conversely, increasing the number of vehicles did not affect the total cost, suggesting that the existing vehicle capacity was sufficient under the tested scenarios.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity:** Changes in vehicle capacity had the most significant impact, with reductions leading to infeasibility in multiple scenarios (Scenarios 8, 9, and 10).
2. **Demand Levels:** Increases in customer demand led to notable cost increases, with ΔObj percentages ranging from 15.8% to 22.5% (Scenarios 5, 6, and 7).
3. **Number of Available Vehicles:** Reducing the number of vehicles to one resulted in infeasibility (Scenario 3), while increasing the number of vehicles did not impact the cost (Scenario 1).
4. **Demand Reductions:** Decreasing demand at specific locations led to a cost reduction of 10.3% (Scenario 4).

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 3:** Reducing the number of available vehicles from 2 to 1 led to model infeasibility, highlighting the critical importance of having at least two vehicles to meet demand.
- **Scenario 8, 9, and 10:** Reducing vehicle capacity to 20, 10, and 25, respectively, resulted in infeasibility, underscoring the model's sensitivity to vehicle capacity constraints.
- **Scenario 7:** Increasing total customer demand by 50% across all locations resulted in the largest cost increase (22.5%), demonstrating the significant impact of demand surges on total cost.
