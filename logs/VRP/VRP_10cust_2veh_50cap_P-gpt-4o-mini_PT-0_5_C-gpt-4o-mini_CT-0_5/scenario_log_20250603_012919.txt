--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes in vehicle capacity and the number of available vehicles have the most significant impact on both the total cost and model feasibility. Specifically, reducing vehicle capacity frequently leads to infeasibility, indicating that the model is highly sensitive to this parameter. Increasing customer demand also results in a substantial increase in total cost, although the model remains feasible. Overall, the model is particularly sensitive to constraints related to vehicle capacity and availability.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity:**
   - Reducing vehicle capacity consistently leads to infeasibility, indicating a high sensitivity to this parameter. Scenarios 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 demonstrate this sensitivity, with multiple instances of infeasibility.
   - When feasible, changes in vehicle capacity also result in significant cost variations, as seen in Scenario 3 with a 26.3% increase in cost.

2. **Number of Available Vehicles:**
   - Reducing the number of vehicles from 2 to 1 or 0 leads to infeasibility, as shown in Scenarios 2 and 10, highlighting the critical role of vehicle availability in maintaining feasibility.

3. **Customer Demand:**
   - Increasing customer demand by 50% results in a substantial cost increase of 22.5% (Scenario 5), indicating sensitivity to demand levels, although the model remains feasible.

4. **Increased Vehicle Capacity:**
   - Increasing vehicle capacity to 100 results in a cost reduction of 10.3% (Scenario 1), showing that higher capacity can improve efficiency and reduce costs.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 4 (Decrease vehicle capacity from 50 to 20):** This scenario is critical as it leads to infeasibility, highlighting the model's sensitivity to reduced vehicle capacity.
- **Scenario 5 (Increase demand by 50%):** This scenario is revealing due to the significant cost increase of 22.5%, demonstrating the impact of increased demand on total cost.
- **Scenario 1 (Increase vehicle capacity to 100):** This scenario shows the potential for cost savings with increased vehicle capacity, resulting in a 10.3% cost reduction.

Overall, the analysis indicates that maintaining adequate vehicle capacity and availability is crucial for model feasibility, while demand levels significantly influence total costs.
