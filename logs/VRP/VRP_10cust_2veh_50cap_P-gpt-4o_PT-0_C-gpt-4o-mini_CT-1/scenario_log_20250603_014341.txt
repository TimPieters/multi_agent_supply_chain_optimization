--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals several key insights:

- **Demand Increases:** Increasing customer demands, whether at specific locations or across all locations, consistently led to significant increases in total cost. This indicates a high sensitivity of the model to changes in demand levels.
  
- **Vehicle Capacity Constraints:** Reducing vehicle capacity resulted in a substantial increase in total cost, highlighting the model's sensitivity to vehicle capacity limitations.

- **Number of Vehicles:** Reducing the number of available vehicles from 2 to 1 led to model infeasibility, demonstrating a critical dependency on having a sufficient number of vehicles to meet demand.

- **Specific Constraints:** Introducing constraints related to travel distance and vehicle routing (e.g., maximum travel distance, frequent returns to the depot) also led to infeasibility or significant cost increases, indicating sensitivity to operational constraints.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Number of Vehicles:** The scenario reducing the number of vehicles to 1 resulted in infeasibility, indicating the highest sensitivity.
2. **Specific Constraints (e.g., Maximum Travel Distance):** Constraints that limit operational flexibility, such as maximum travel distance, led to infeasibility, showing high sensitivity.
3. **Demand Levels:** Both specific and overall demand increases led to significant cost increases (up to 29.2%), indicating strong sensitivity.
4. **Vehicle Capacity:** Reducing vehicle capacity resulted in a 26.3% increase in cost, showing notable sensitivity.
5. **Other Specific Constraints:** Constraints requiring specific routing behaviors (e.g., serving distant customers) resulted in cost increases but did not cause infeasibility, indicating moderate sensitivity.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1:** Reducing the number of vehicles from 2 to 1 caused infeasibility, highlighting the critical importance of vehicle availability.
  
- **Scenario 6:** Introducing a maximum travel distance constraint led to infeasibility, underscoring the sensitivity to operational range limitations.

- **Scenario 10:** Requiring vehicles to serve distant customers resulted in the largest cost increase (29.2%), revealing the impact of long-distance routing requirements.

These scenarios are particularly revealing as they demonstrate the model's limitations and the significant impact of certain constraints and parameter changes on feasibility and cost.

1. Scenario: 'Reduce the number of available vehicles from 2 to 1 to test the feasibility and impact on total cost when vehicle resources are constrained.' -> Error: Execution Result: Model Infeasible
2. Scenario: 'Increase the demand at customer locations 4 and 11 by 50% to test the impact on total cost and feasibility when high-demand customers are present.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 382.11, ΔObj: 52.01 (15.8%)
3. Scenario: 'Increase the demand at all customer locations by 30% to test the impact on total cost and feasibility when overall demand is significantly higher.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 382.11, ΔObj: 52.01 (15.8%)
4. Scenario: 'Reduce the vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 to test the impact on total cost and feasibility when vehicle capacity is significantly constrained.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 416.89, ΔObj: 86.79 (26.3%)
5. Scenario: 'Introduce a constraint that requires each vehicle to serve at least one high-demand customer (demand ≥ 7) to test the impact on route optimization and feasibility when balancing high-demand customer assignments.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
6. Scenario: 'Introduce a constraint that limits the maximum travel distance for each vehicle to 150 units to test the impact on total cost and feasibility when vehicles have restricted range.' -> Error: Execution Result: Model Infeasible
7. Scenario: 'Introduce a constraint that requires each vehicle to return to the depot after serving every two customers to test the impact on total cost and feasibility when vehicles have frequent return requirements.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
8. Scenario: 'Introduce a constraint that requires each vehicle to serve at least three different customer locations before returning to the depot to test the impact on total cost and feasibility when vehicles have extended service requirements.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
9. Scenario: 'Introduce a constraint that requires each vehicle to serve a minimum of four customer locations with a combined demand of at least 20 units before returning to the depot to test the impact on total cost and feasibility when vehicles have both extended service and demand requirements.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
10. Scenario: 'Introduce a constraint that requires each vehicle to serve at least one customer located more than 70 distance units away from the depot to test the impact on total cost and feasibility when vehicles are required to cover long-distance routes.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 426.54, ΔObj: 96.44 (29.2%)
