--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes in vehicle capacity and customer demand levels have the most significant impact on both the total cost and model feasibility. Specifically, reducing vehicle capacity and increasing customer demands often lead to substantial increases in costs and, in some cases, model infeasibility. Introducing new constraints, such as requiring vehicles to serve specific customer types or travel minimum distances, generally did not affect feasibility but sometimes resulted in cost changes. The addition of new customer locations also posed challenges, leading to model execution failures.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity Reductions:**
   - Most impactful in terms of causing infeasibility and significant cost increases.
   - Scenarios 3, 7, and 8 highlight the sensitivity to capacity constraints.

2. **Demand Level Increases:**
   - Particularly impactful when demands are increased significantly or at critical locations.
   - Scenarios 1, 6, and 8 demonstrate the sensitivity to demand changes.

3. **Number of Vehicles:**
   - Reducing the number of vehicles led to infeasibility, indicating high sensitivity.
   - Scenario 2 is a key example.

4. **Addition of New Customer Locations:**
   - Led to model execution failures, indicating challenges in handling expanded service requirements.
   - Scenario 9 is critical here.

5. **Specific Constraints:**
   - Constraints related to route distribution and prioritized deliveries had minimal impact on costs but were feasible.
   - Scenarios 4, 5, and 10 show the impact of specific constraints.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 2:** Reducing the number of vehicles from 2 to 1 resulted in model infeasibility, highlighting the critical role of vehicle availability.
- **Scenario 3:** Decreasing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 led to a significant cost increase of 26.3%, demonstrating the sensitivity to capacity constraints.
- **Scenario 8:** Drastically increasing demand at a location near the depot and reducing vehicle capacity to 25 caused infeasibility, underscoring the impact of high-demand locations combined with low capacity.
- **Scenario 9:** Adding new customer locations resulted in model execution failure, indicating challenges in adapting to expanded service requirements.


--- Scenario Log ---
1. Scenario: 'Increase the demand at the locations with previously low demands (customers 1, 5, and 7) by 50% to evaluate the impact on vehicle capacity utilization and routing feasibility.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 382.11, ΔObj: 52.01 (15.8%)
2. Scenario: 'Reduce the number of available vehicles from 2 to 1 to test the feasibility and impact on costs with limited routing options.' -> Error: Execution Result: Model Infeasible
3. Scenario: 'Decrease the vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 and redistribute demands to increase congestion and test route optimization under tighter capacity constraints.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 416.89, ΔObj: 86.79 (26.3%)
4. Scenario: 'Introduce a constraint requiring that each vehicle must serve at least three different customer locations to test the impact on route distribution and feasibility under more dispersed delivery conditions.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
5. Scenario: 'Scenario: "Impose a constraint where each vehicle must visit at least one high-demand customer location (customers 4, 10, and 11) to evaluate how vehicle allocation strategies adapt under the pressure of prioritized deliveries and the impact on total distance traveled."' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
6. Scenario: 'Scenario: "Reduce the vehicle capacity to 40 and increase the demand of the two furthest customer locations (customers 3 and 6) by 50% to test the impact on feasibility and cost under compounded distance and demand constraints."' -> Status: Error (Model execution failed or 'model' not found in locals_dict.)
7. Scenario: 'Reduce vehicle capacity to 35 and increase demand at the depot to 10 while imposing a constraint that both vehicles must leave the depot fully loaded before performing any delivery to evaluate the impact on distance optimization and feasibility under higher dispatch constraints.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 404.51, ΔObj: 74.41 (22.5%)
8. Scenario: '"Drastically increase the demand at the location closest to the depot (customer 3) by 200% and reduce the vehicle capacity to 25 to evaluate the aggregation impact on route feasibility and costs when handling high-demand near-depot deliveries."' -> Error: Execution Result: Model Infeasible
9. Scenario: '"Increase the number of customer locations (n_customers) by adding five new customer points with random coordinates and varied high demands ranging from 10 to 20, while maintaining the current number of vehicles and vehicle capacity to explore the impact on cost and feasibility under expanded service requirements."' -> Status: Error (Model execution failed or 'model' not found in locals_dict.)
10. Scenario: '"Introduce a constraint that both vehicles must travel at least a cumulative distance of 150 units before returning to the depot, and increase the demand for the three most distant customer locations (customers 4, 5, and 6) by 50% to test the impact on routing efficiency and feasibility when balancing priority demands with mandatory travel distance."' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
