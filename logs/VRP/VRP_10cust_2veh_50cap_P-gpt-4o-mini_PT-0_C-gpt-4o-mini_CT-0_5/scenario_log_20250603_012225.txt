--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes in customer demand levels have a significant impact on both the total cost and model feasibility. Specifically, increasing the demand of individual customers often leads to substantial increases in the total cost, with some scenarios resulting in a cost increase of over 35%. Additionally, one scenario resulted in model infeasibility, indicating that demand increases can push the system beyond its operational limits. In contrast, changes in the number of vehicles available did not affect the total cost, suggesting that the current vehicle fleet is sufficient to handle the demand levels tested.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Demand Levels:** Changes in customer demand levels had the most significant impact on the model. Large increases in demand for specific customers led to substantial cost increases and, in one case, model infeasibility.
2. **Vehicle Capacity:** Reducing vehicle capacity resulted in a notable increase in total cost, indicating sensitivity to capacity constraints.
3. **Number of Vehicles:** Increasing the number of vehicles did not impact the total cost, suggesting that the model is less sensitive to changes in fleet size under the tested conditions.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 6:** Increasing the demand of customer 6 from 3 to 40 resulted in the largest cost increase of 35.5% (ΔObj: 117.06), highlighting the significant impact of demand changes on cost.
- **Scenario 10:** Increasing the demand of customer 7 from 3 to 60 led to model infeasibility, demonstrating the critical threshold at which demand increases can no longer be accommodated by the current system.
- **Scenario 1:** Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 resulted in a 26.3% increase in cost (ΔObj: 86.79), indicating the importance of vehicle capacity in maintaining cost efficiency.
