--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals several key insights:

- **Demand Increases:** Increasing customer demands, either at specific locations or uniformly across the network, consistently led to significant increases in total cost. This indicates a high sensitivity of the model to changes in demand levels.
  
- **Vehicle Capacity Limits:** Reducing vehicle capacity had a substantial impact on total cost, suggesting that the model is sensitive to constraints on vehicle load capacity.

- **Number of Vehicles:** Reducing the number of available vehicles from 2 to 1 resulted in model infeasibility, highlighting the critical role of vehicle availability in maintaining feasibility.

- **Specific Constraints:** Introducing constraints related to routing flexibility, such as requiring vehicles to serve high-demand customers or cover longer distances, generally resulted in optimal solutions with moderate cost increases. However, constraints that limited maximum travel distance led to infeasibility, indicating a sensitivity to route length restrictions.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Number of Vehicles:** Most impactful, as reducing vehicles led to infeasibility.
2. **Vehicle Capacity:** Significant impact on cost (26.3% increase) when capacity was reduced.
3. **Demand Levels:** Notable cost increases (15.8%) when demands were increased.
4. **Specific Constraints (Distance Limits):** Led to infeasibility when maximum travel distance was restricted.
5. **Specific Constraints (Routing Flexibility):** Moderate impact on cost, but generally feasible.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1:** Reducing the number of vehicles from 2 to 1 caused infeasibility, highlighting the critical importance of vehicle availability.
  
- **Scenario 3:** Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 resulted in the largest cost increase (26.3%), indicating high sensitivity to vehicle load constraints.

- **Scenario 5:** Introducing a maximum travel distance constraint led to infeasibility, revealing the model's sensitivity to route length restrictions.

These scenarios provide valuable insights into the parameters that most significantly affect the VRP model's feasibility and cost efficiency.

10. Scenario: 'Introduce a constraint that requires each vehicle to serve at least one customer located more than 80 distance units from the depot and simultaneously serve a customer with a demand of 7 or more to test the impact on total cost and feasibility when vehicles are required to cover longer distances while also prioritizing high-demand customers.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 365.25, ΔObj: 35.15 (10.6%)
