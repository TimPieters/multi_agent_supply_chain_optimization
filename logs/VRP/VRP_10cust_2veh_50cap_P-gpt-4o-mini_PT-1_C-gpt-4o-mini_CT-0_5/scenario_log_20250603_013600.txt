--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals several key insights:

- **Demand Increases:** Increasing customer demand, particularly for high-demand customers, consistently led to significant increases in total cost. However, these scenarios generally remained feasible, indicating that the model can accommodate demand surges up to a certain extent without becoming infeasible.
  
- **Vehicle Capacity Changes:** Adjusting vehicle capacity had a notable impact on the model. Increasing capacity led to a decrease in total cost, suggesting improved efficiency and utilization. Conversely, decreasing capacity resulted in infeasibility, highlighting the critical role of vehicle capacity in maintaining model feasibility.

- **Number of Vehicles:** Reducing the number of available vehicles caused infeasibility, underscoring the importance of having a sufficient fleet size to meet customer demands. Increasing the number of vehicles did not affect the total cost, indicating that the existing fleet size was already optimal for the given demand.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity Decrease:** This change had the most significant impact, leading to model infeasibility, demonstrating its critical role in maintaining feasibility.
   
2. **Number of Vehicles Decrease:** Reducing the number of vehicles also resulted in infeasibility, showing its importance in ensuring all customer demands are met.

3. **Demand Increases for High-Demand Customers:** These changes led to substantial increases in total cost (up to 15.8%), indicating high sensitivity to demand fluctuations for key customers.

4. **Vehicle Capacity Increase:** Increasing capacity resulted in a notable decrease in total cost (up to -10.3%), highlighting its potential for cost optimization.

5. **Demand Increases for Low-Demand Customers:** These changes had minimal impact on cost and feasibility, indicating lower sensitivity.

6. **Number of Vehicles Increase:** This change had no impact on cost, suggesting that the existing fleet size was sufficient.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1 and 9:** Both scenarios involved reducing resources (vehicles and capacity) and resulted in model infeasibility, highlighting the critical thresholds for maintaining feasibility.

- **Scenario 2 and 4:** Increasing demand for high-demand customers led to the largest cost increase (15.8%), revealing the sensitivity of the model to demand surges in key areas.

- **Scenario 3 and 7:** Increasing vehicle capacity resulted in the largest cost decrease (-10.3%), demonstrating the potential for cost savings through capacity optimization.

These scenarios provide valuable insights into the parameters that most significantly affect the VRP model's performance and feasibility.
