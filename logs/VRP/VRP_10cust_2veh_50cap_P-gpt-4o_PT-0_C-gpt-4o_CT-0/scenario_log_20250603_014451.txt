--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals several key insights:

- **Demand Increases:** Increasing customer demands, particularly at specific locations, significantly impacts the total cost. Scenarios involving demand increases at specific customer locations resulted in notable cost increases, indicating a high sensitivity to demand changes.
  
- **Vehicle Capacity Reductions:** Reducing vehicle capacity had a substantial impact on the model's cost, suggesting that the model is sensitive to changes in vehicle capacity constraints.

- **Number of Vehicles:** Reducing the number of available vehicles led to model infeasibility, highlighting the critical role of vehicle availability in maintaining feasibility.

- **New Constraints:** Introducing new constraints generally did not affect the cost significantly, except when they led to infeasibility, such as limiting maximum travel distance per vehicle.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Number of Vehicles:** The most impactful change, as reducing the number of vehicles from 2 to 1 led to infeasibility.
2. **Vehicle Capacity:** Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 resulted in a significant cost increase (ΔObj: 26.3%).
3. **Demand Levels:** Increasing demands at specific customer locations led to notable cost increases (e.g., ΔObj: 15.8% and 9.8%).
4. **Specific Constraints:** Introducing constraints that limit travel distance per vehicle led to infeasibility, indicating sensitivity to such constraints.
5. **Other New Constraints:** Other constraints, such as requiring vehicles to serve specific types of customers or return to the depot after serving a set number of customers, generally had no impact on cost.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1:** Reducing the number of vehicles from 2 to 1 resulted in model infeasibility, highlighting the critical importance of vehicle availability.
  
- **Scenario 4:** Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 led to the largest cost increase (ΔObj: 26.3%), indicating high sensitivity to vehicle capacity constraints.

- **Scenario 8:** Introducing a constraint that limits the maximum travel distance for each vehicle to 150 units also resulted in infeasibility, underscoring the sensitivity to travel distance constraints.
