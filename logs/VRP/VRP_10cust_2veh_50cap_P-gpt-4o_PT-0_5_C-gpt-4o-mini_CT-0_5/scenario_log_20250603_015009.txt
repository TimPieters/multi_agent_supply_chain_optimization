--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes in vehicle capacity and the number of available vehicles have the most significant impact on model feasibility and total cost. Specifically, reducing the number of vehicles or vehicle capacity often leads to infeasibility or substantial increases in total distance traveled. Demand increases also significantly impact the total cost, though they do not lead to infeasibility in the scenarios tested. Introducing specific constraints related to customer assignments or travel distances generally results in optimal solutions with moderate cost increases, except when constraints severely limit vehicle travel, which can lead to infeasibility.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity and Number of Vehicles:**
   - Most impactful, with scenarios leading to infeasibility or significant cost increases (e.g., reducing vehicles from 2 to 1, reducing capacity from 50 to 30).

2. **Demand Levels:**
   - Significant impact on cost, with a 50% increase in demand leading to a 22.5% increase in total cost.

3. **Specific Constraints:**
   - Moderate impact on cost, with some constraints causing infeasibility (e.g., maximum distance constraint) and others resulting in optimal solutions with no cost change.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1:** Reducing the number of available vehicles from 2 to 1 resulted in model infeasibility, highlighting the critical role of vehicle availability in maintaining feasibility.
  
- **Scenario 4:** Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 led to a 26.3% increase in total cost, indicating the sensitivity of the model to vehicle capacity constraints.

- **Scenario 2:** Increasing demand by 50% resulted in a 22.5% increase in total cost, demonstrating the significant impact of demand changes on the model's objective.

- **Scenario 5:** Introducing a maximum distance constraint for vehicles led to infeasibility, underscoring the importance of travel flexibility in route optimization.
