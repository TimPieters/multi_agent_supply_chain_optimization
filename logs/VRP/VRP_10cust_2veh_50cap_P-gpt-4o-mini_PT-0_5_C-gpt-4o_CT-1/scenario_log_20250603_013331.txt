--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes in customer demand levels and vehicle capacity have significant impacts on the total cost. Specifically, increasing customer demands, especially by large percentages, tends to increase the total cost substantially. Conversely, increasing vehicle capacity can lead to cost reductions, indicating improved efficiency in routing. The number of vehicles available also plays a role, but its impact on cost is less pronounced compared to demand changes and vehicle capacity adjustments. Notably, none of the scenarios led to infeasibility, suggesting that the model is robust under the tested conditions.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Demand Levels:** Changes in customer demand, particularly large increases (e.g., 200% to 500%), consistently resulted in significant cost increases, with ΔObj % ranging from 9.8% to 19.2%.
2. **Vehicle Capacity:** Reducing vehicle capacity led to a notable cost increase (26.3%), while increasing capacity resulted in a cost decrease (-10.3%).
3. **Number of Vehicles:** Increasing the number of vehicles generally did not affect the cost significantly, with ΔObj % at 0.0% in several scenarios, indicating that the model can efficiently utilize additional vehicles without cost penalties.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1:** Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 resulted in the largest cost increase (26.3%), highlighting the critical role of vehicle capacity in maintaining cost efficiency.
- **Scenario 10:** Increasing the demand of customer 1 by 500% led to the highest cost increase among demand changes (19.2%), underscoring the sensitivity of the model to extreme demand spikes.
- **Scenario 8:** Increasing vehicle capacity from 50 to 70 resulted in a cost decrease of 10.3%, demonstrating the potential for cost savings through increased capacity.

These scenarios are particularly revealing as they highlight the model's sensitivity to capacity constraints and demand fluctuations, providing insights into areas where operational adjustments could yield significant cost benefits or challenges.
