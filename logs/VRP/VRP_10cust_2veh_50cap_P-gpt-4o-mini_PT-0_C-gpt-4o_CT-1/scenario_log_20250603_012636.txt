--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes in customer demand levels have the most significant impact on both the total cost and model feasibility. Specifically, increasing the demand of individual customers often leads to substantial increases in total cost and, in one case, model infeasibility. Reducing vehicle capacity also results in a notable increase in total cost, although it does not lead to infeasibility in the scenarios tested. Increasing the number of vehicles does not significantly impact the total cost or feasibility, suggesting that the model is not highly sensitive to this parameter under the tested conditions.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Demand Levels:** 
   - Increasing customer demand consistently leads to significant cost increases and, in one instance, model infeasibility. This parameter is the most impactful, with ΔObj percentages ranging from 9.8% to 37.5% and one scenario resulting in infeasibility.

2. **Vehicle Capacity:**
   - Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 results in a 26.3% increase in total cost, indicating a high sensitivity to capacity constraints.

3. **Number of Vehicles:**
   - Increasing the number of vehicles from 2 to 4 or 5 does not affect the total cost or feasibility, indicating low sensitivity to this parameter in the tested scenarios.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 9:** Increasing the demand of customer 2 from 3 to 50 results in the largest cost increase (ΔObj: 123.76, 37.5%), highlighting the critical impact of demand changes on cost.
  
- **Scenario 10:** Increasing the demand of customer 7 from 3 to 50 leads to model infeasibility, demonstrating the potential for demand increases to exceed vehicle capacity and disrupt feasibility.

- **Scenario 1:** Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 results in a significant cost increase (ΔObj: 86.79, 26.3%), underscoring the importance of vehicle capacity in maintaining cost efficiency.


--- Scenario Log ---
1. Scenario: 'Reduce the vehicle capacity from 50 to 30, which may lead to infeasibility due to increased demand exceeding the new capacity limits.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 416.89, ΔObj: 86.79 (26.3%)
2. Scenario: 'Increase the number of vehicles from 2 to 4, which may lead to a significant reduction in total distance traveled but could also reveal potential routing inefficiencies or increased operational costs.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
3. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of customer 3 from 7 to 20, which may lead to infeasibility due to exceeding the vehicle capacity with the current number of vehicles.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
4. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of customer 5 from 9 to 25, which may lead to infeasibility due to exceeding the vehicle capacity with the current number of vehicles.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
5. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of customer 1 from 3 to 30, which may lead to infeasibility due to exceeding the vehicle capacity with the current number of vehicles.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 393.39, ΔObj: 63.29 (19.2%)
6. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of customer 6 from 3 to 40, which may lead to infeasibility due to exceeding the vehicle capacity with the current number of vehicles.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 447.16, ΔObj: 117.06 (35.5%)
7. Scenario: 'Increase the number of vehicles from 2 to 5, which may lead to a significant reduction in total distance traveled but could also reveal potential routing inefficiencies and increased operational costs, potentially leading to infeasibility if the demand exceeds the combined vehicle capacity.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
8. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of customer 4 from 9 to 35, which may lead to infeasibility due to exceeding the vehicle capacity with the current number of vehicles.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 362.57, ΔObj: 32.47 (9.8%)
9. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of customer 2 from 3 to 50, which may lead to infeasibility due to exceeding the vehicle capacity with the current number of vehicles.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 453.86, ΔObj: 123.76 (37.5%)
10. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of customer 7 from 3 to 50, which may lead to infeasibility due to exceeding the vehicle capacity with the current number of vehicles.' -> Error: Execution Result: Model Infeasible
