--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes in vehicle capacity and the number of available vehicles have the most significant impact on model feasibility and cost. Decreasing vehicle capacity consistently led to model infeasibility, indicating that the current demand levels cannot be met with reduced capacity. Similarly, reducing the number of vehicles from 2 to 1 resulted in infeasibility, highlighting the critical role of vehicle availability in meeting customer demands. In contrast, increasing individual customer demands did not affect feasibility but did result in moderate cost increases.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity:** Decreasing vehicle capacity was the most impactful change, frequently leading to model infeasibility (Scenarios 4, 6, 7, 9). When feasible, it resulted in significant cost increases (Scenario 2: 26.3% increase).
   
2. **Number of Available Vehicles:** Reducing the number of vehicles from 2 to 1 led to model infeasibility (Scenario 3), indicating a high sensitivity to vehicle availability.

3. **Demand Levels:** Increasing customer demands did not lead to infeasibility but did cause moderate cost increases (Scenario 8: 15.8% increase; Scenario 10: 22.5% increase).

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 2:** Decreasing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 resulted in a significant cost increase of 26.3%, highlighting the sensitivity of the model to capacity constraints.
  
- **Scenario 3:** Reducing the number of vehicles from 2 to 1 led to infeasibility, underscoring the importance of vehicle availability in maintaining model feasibility.

- **Scenario 4, 6, 7, 9:** These scenarios consistently resulted in infeasibility when vehicle capacity was reduced to 20, 10, 15, and 5, respectively, demonstrating the critical threshold of vehicle capacity needed to meet demand.

Overall, the analysis indicates that maintaining adequate vehicle capacity and availability is crucial for the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the VRP model.


--- Scenario Log ---
1. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of customer 3 from 7 to 25, which will exceed the vehicle capacity and likely lead to infeasibility in the routing solution.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
2. Scenario: 'Decrease the vehicle capacity from 50 to 30, which will likely lead to infeasibility in serving the current customer demands with the available number of vehicles.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 416.89, ΔObj: 86.79 (26.3%)
3. Scenario: 'Decrease the number of available vehicles from 2 to 1, which will likely lead to infeasibility in serving all customer demands within the given vehicle capacity.' -> Error: Execution Result: Model Infeasible
4. Scenario: 'Decrease the vehicle capacity from 50 to 20, which will likely lead to infeasibility in serving the current customer demands with the available number of vehicles.' -> Error: Execution Result: Model Infeasible
5. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of customer 5 from 9 to 30, which will exceed the vehicle capacity and likely lead to infeasibility in serving all customer demands.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
6. Scenario: 'Decrease the vehicle capacity from 50 to 10, which will likely lead to infeasibility in serving the current customer demands given the high total demand across all customers.' -> Error: Execution Result: Model Infeasible
7. Scenario: 'Decrease the vehicle capacity from 50 to 15, which will likely lead to infeasibility in serving the current customer demands with the available number of vehicles.' -> Error: Execution Result: Model Infeasible
8. Scenario: 'Decrease the demand of customer 1 from 0 to 10, which will exceed the vehicle capacity and likely lead to infeasibility in serving all customer demands.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 382.11, ΔObj: 52.01 (15.8%)
9. Scenario: 'Decrease the vehicle capacity from 50 to 5, which will significantly exceed the total demand across all customers and likely lead to infeasibility in serving them with the available number of vehicles.' -> Error: Execution Result: Model Infeasible
10. Scenario: 'Decrease the demand of customer 6 from 5 to 20, which will exceed the vehicle capacity and likely lead to infeasibility in serving all customer demands.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 404.51, ΔObj: 74.41 (22.5%)
