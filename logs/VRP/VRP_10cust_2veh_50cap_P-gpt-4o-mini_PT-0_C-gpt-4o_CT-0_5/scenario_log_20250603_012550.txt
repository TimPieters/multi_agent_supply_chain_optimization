--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes in customer demand, particularly for high-demand customers, and vehicle capacity have the most significant impact on both the total cost and model feasibility. Increasing the demand of high-demand customers frequently led to model infeasibility, indicating a critical sensitivity to demand levels. Conversely, changes in vehicle capacity showed a notable impact on cost, with both increases and decreases affecting the total distance traveled. Increasing the number of vehicles did not significantly impact the cost or feasibility, suggesting that the current vehicle fleet size is sufficient for the demand levels tested.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Demand Levels:**
   - Increasing demand for high-demand customers often led to infeasibility, indicating a high sensitivity to demand changes.
   - Scenarios 3, 5, 6, 7, and 10 resulted in errors or infeasibility due to increased demand.

2. **Vehicle Capacity:**
   - Reducing vehicle capacity led to a significant cost increase (Scenario 1: ΔObj 26.3%).
   - Increasing vehicle capacity resulted in a cost decrease (Scenario 8: ΔObj -10.3%).

3. **Number of Vehicles:**
   - Increasing the number of vehicles did not affect the cost (Scenarios 2 and 9: ΔObj 0.0%).

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1:** Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 resulted in a significant cost increase (ΔObj 26.3%), highlighting the sensitivity of the model to vehicle capacity constraints.
- **Scenario 8:** Increasing vehicle capacity from 50 to 70 led to a cost decrease (ΔObj -10.3%), demonstrating potential routing efficiencies gained from higher capacity.
- **Scenario 7 and 10:** Increasing the demand of the highest-demand customer to 35 and 50, respectively, led to model infeasibility, underscoring the critical impact of demand levels on feasibility.


--- Scenario Log ---
1. Scenario: 'Reduce the vehicle capacity from 50 to 30, which may lead to infeasibility due to increased demand exceeding the new capacity limits.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 416.89, ΔObj: 86.79 (26.3%)
2. Scenario: 'Increase the number of vehicles from 2 to 4, which may lead to a significant reduction in total distance traveled but could also reveal potential routing inefficiencies or increased operational costs.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
3. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of the highest-demand customer (currently 9) to 20, which may lead to infeasibility due to exceeding the vehicle capacity with the current number of vehicles.' -> Status: Error (Model execution failed or 'model' not found in locals_dict.)
4. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of the second highest-demand customer (currently 9) to 25, which may lead to infeasibility due to exceeding the vehicle capacity with the current number of vehicles.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 362.57, ΔObj: 32.47 (9.8%)
5. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of the lowest-demand customer (currently 3) to 15, which may lead to infeasibility due to exceeding the vehicle capacity with the current number of vehicles.' -> Status: Error (Model execution failed or 'model' not found in locals_dict.)
6. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of the customer with the second highest demand (currently 9) to 30, which may lead to infeasibility due to exceeding the vehicle capacity with the current number of vehicles.' -> Status: Error (Model execution failed or 'model' not found in locals_dict.)
7. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of the customer with the highest demand (currently 9) to 35, which may lead to infeasibility due to exceeding the vehicle capacity with the current number of vehicles.' -> Error: Execution Result: Model Infeasible
8. Scenario: 'Increase the vehicle capacity from 50 to 70, which may lead to a significant reduction in total distance traveled and reveal potential routing efficiencies or changes in customer assignments.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 296.26, ΔObj: -33.84 (-10.3%)
9. Scenario: 'Increase the number of vehicles from 2 to 5, which may lead to significant routing changes and potential infeasibility due to increased demand exceeding the combined vehicle capacity.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1, ΔObj: 0.0 (0.0%)
10. Scenario: 'Increase the demand of the customer with the highest demand (currently 9) to 50, which may lead to infeasibility due to exceeding the vehicle capacity with the current number of vehicles.' -> Error: Execution Result: Model Infeasible
