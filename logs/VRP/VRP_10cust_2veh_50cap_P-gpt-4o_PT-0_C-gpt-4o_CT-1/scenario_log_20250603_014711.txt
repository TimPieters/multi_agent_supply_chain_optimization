--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes in vehicle capacity and the introduction of specific constraints have the most significant impact on model feasibility and total cost. Reducing the number of available vehicles or vehicle capacity often leads to infeasibility, indicating that the model is highly sensitive to these parameters. Demand increases at specific customer locations also result in notable cost increases, although they generally maintain feasibility. Introducing constraints that dictate specific vehicle assignments can lead to both significant cost changes and infeasibility, depending on the nature of the constraint.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity:**
   - Reducing vehicle capacity consistently leads to significant cost increases and can cause infeasibility (e.g., Scenario 4 and 8).

2. **Specific Constraints:**
   - Introducing constraints that require specific customer locations to be served by the same or different vehicles can lead to infeasibility or significant cost changes (e.g., Scenario 6 and 9).

3. **Number of Vehicles:**
   - Reducing the number of available vehicles directly leads to infeasibility (e.g., Scenario 1).

4. **Demand Levels:**
   - Increasing demand at specific customer locations results in moderate to significant cost increases but generally maintains feasibility (e.g., Scenario 2, 3, and 7).

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1:** Reducing the number of vehicles from 2 to 1 resulted in infeasibility, highlighting the critical role of vehicle availability in maintaining feasibility.
  
- **Scenario 4:** Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 led to a significant cost increase of 26.3%, demonstrating the sensitivity of the model to vehicle capacity changes.

- **Scenario 8:** The combination of reducing vehicle capacity and increasing demand at a specific location resulted in infeasibility, underscoring the compounded impact of simultaneous parameter changes.

- **Scenario 9:** Introducing a constraint that required specific customer locations to be served by the same vehicle led to the largest cost increase of 33.2%, indicating the high impact of route-specific constraints on total cost.
