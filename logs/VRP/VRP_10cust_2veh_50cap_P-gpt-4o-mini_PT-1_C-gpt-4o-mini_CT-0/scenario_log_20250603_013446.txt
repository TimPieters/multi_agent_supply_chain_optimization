--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals several key insights:

- **Vehicle Capacity Changes:** Reducing vehicle capacity had a significant impact on total costs, as seen in Scenario 1, where a decrease in capacity led to a 26.3% increase in costs. Conversely, increasing vehicle capacity resulted in a cost reduction, as shown in Scenario 7 with a 10.3% decrease.
  
- **Demand Increases:** Increasing demand at specific customer locations generally led to increased costs, with the most significant impact observed when demands were increased at multiple locations simultaneously. However, some demand increases did not affect costs, suggesting that the model could absorb certain demand changes without additional costs.

- **Number of Vehicles:** Increasing the number of vehicles did not impact costs, indicating that the existing vehicle count was sufficient for the demand distribution. However, reducing the number of vehicles to one led to infeasibility, highlighting the critical role of vehicle availability in maintaining model feasibility.

- **Infeasibility:** The only scenario that resulted in infeasibility was the reduction of vehicles to one, underscoring the importance of having a minimum number of vehicles to meet demand.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity Changes:** Most impactful in terms of cost changes and feasibility.
2. **Demand Levels:** Significant impact on costs, especially when increased at multiple locations.
3. **Number of Vehicles:** Critical for feasibility, with a reduction leading to infeasibility.
4. **Specific Demand Increases:** Some specific increases had no cost impact, indicating variability in sensitivity.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1:** Decreasing vehicle capacity to 30 units resulted in the largest cost increase (26.3%), highlighting the sensitivity of the model to capacity constraints.
  
- **Scenario 8:** Reducing the number of vehicles to one led to model infeasibility, demonstrating the critical need for a minimum number of vehicles to maintain feasibility.

- **Scenario 7:** Increasing vehicle capacity to 100 units resulted in a significant cost decrease (-10.3%), showing the potential benefits of excess capacity in reducing costs.

These scenarios provide valuable insights into the parameters that most significantly affect the VRP model's performance and feasibility.
