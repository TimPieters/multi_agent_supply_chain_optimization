--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes related to vehicle capacity and demand levels have the most significant impact on both the total cost and model feasibility. Specifically, scenarios that involve reducing vehicle capacity or increasing customer demand tend to result in substantial increases in total cost and, in some cases, lead to infeasibility. Introducing specific constraints related to route assignments or customer service requirements generally resulted in optimal solutions without significant cost changes, indicating that these constraints are less impactful compared to capacity and demand changes.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity Reduction:**
   - Most impactful, leading to both significant cost increases and infeasibility.
   - Example: Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 resulted in a 26.3% cost increase.
   - Reducing the number of vehicles from 2 to 1 led to infeasibility.

2. **Demand Increases:**
   - Significant impact on cost, especially when demand is concentrated or uniformly increased.
   - Example: Increasing demand at the highest demand location by 50% resulted in a 9.8% cost increase.
   - Uniform demand increase by 20% led to a 15.8% cost increase.

3. **Specific Route/Customer Constraints:**
   - Generally resulted in optimal solutions with minimal cost impact.
   - Example: Introducing constraints for long-distance travel or specific customer service requirements resulted in cost increases up to 29.2% but did not cause infeasibility.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1:** Reducing the number of available vehicles from 2 to 1 was critical as it led to model infeasibility, highlighting the importance of having sufficient vehicle capacity.
- **Scenario 5:** Introducing a constraint for long-distance travel resulted in the largest cost increase (29.2%), indicating the sensitivity of the model to travel distance constraints.
- **Scenario 3:** Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 caused a significant cost increase (26.3%), underscoring the critical role of vehicle capacity in cost optimization.

These scenarios demonstrate the model's sensitivity to capacity constraints and demand fluctuations, which are crucial for maintaining feasibility and minimizing costs.
