--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**
The sensitivity analysis of the Capacitated Facility Location Problem (CFLP) model reveals that changes in fixed costs and facility capacities significantly impact the total cost. Specifically, increasing the fixed costs of all facilities by 25% resulted in the largest percentage increase in total cost (40.0%). Capacity limitations on individual facilities also led to notable cost increases, though to a lesser extent than the fixed cost change. No scenarios resulted in infeasibility, indicating that the model is robust to the tested changes within the given constraints.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**
1. **Fixed Costs:** Increasing the fixed costs of all facilities by 25% had the most significant impact, with a 40.0% increase in total cost.
2. **Facility Capacities:** Limiting the capacity of individual facilities (facilities 1, 3, 4, and 5) resulted in cost increases ranging from 19.1% to 19.9%. These changes were consistent in their impact, indicating that capacity constraints are a critical factor in cost management.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**
- **Scenario 1:** "Increase the fixed costs of all facilities by 25%." This scenario was particularly revealing as it caused the largest cost swing with a 40.0% increase in total cost, highlighting the sensitivity of the model to changes in fixed costs.
- **Scenarios 2, 3, 4, and 5:** Limiting the capacity of individual facilities (facility 4 to 50, facility 1 to 50, facility 5 to 40, and facility 3 to 30) consistently resulted in similar cost increases (around 19.1% to 19.9%), demonstrating the importance of capacity constraints in the model's cost structure.

Overall, the analysis indicates that both fixed costs and facility capacities are critical parameters influencing the CFLP model's total cost, with fixed costs having the most pronounced effect.
