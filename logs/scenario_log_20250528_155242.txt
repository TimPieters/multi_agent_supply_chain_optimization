--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals several key insights:

- **Vehicle Capacity Changes:** Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 resulted in a significant increase in total cost (ΔObj: 26.3%), indicating that vehicle capacity is a critical factor in maintaining cost efficiency. Conversely, increasing vehicle capacity to 70 reduced costs by 10.3%, suggesting that higher capacity can lead to more efficient routing and lower total distances traveled.

- **Number of Vehicles:** Increasing the number of available vehicles from 2 to 5 did not impact the total cost (ΔObj: 0.0%), indicating that the original number of vehicles was sufficient to meet demand, and excess capacity did not contribute to cost savings.

- **Demand Changes:** Attempts to increase demand for specific high-demand customers resulted in execution errors, preventing a direct assessment of their impact. However, these errors suggest potential issues in handling demand increases within the current model setup.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity:** Changes in vehicle capacity had the most significant impact on cost, with both reductions and increases leading to notable changes in total distance traveled and cost efficiency.
   
2. **Demand Levels:** Although direct impacts could not be assessed due to execution errors, the attempt to increase demand for high-demand customers suggests that demand levels are a sensitive parameter that could potentially lead to infeasibility or significant cost changes.

3. **Number of Vehicles:** Increasing the number of vehicles did not affect the cost, indicating lower sensitivity compared to vehicle capacity and demand levels.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1:** Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 was particularly revealing, as it caused the largest cost increase (ΔObj: 26.3%), highlighting the importance of maintaining adequate vehicle capacity to manage costs effectively.

- **Scenario 5:** Increasing vehicle capacity to 70 resulted in a notable cost reduction (ΔObj: -10.3%), demonstrating the potential benefits of higher capacity in optimizing routes and reducing travel distances.

- **Scenarios 3 and 4:** These scenarios, which involved increasing demand for specific customers, resulted in execution errors. This indicates potential model limitations or errors in handling demand increases, which could be critical for future model adjustments or debugging efforts.
