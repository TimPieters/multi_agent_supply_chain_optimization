--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes in vehicle capacity and customer demand have significant impacts on both the total cost and model feasibility. Specifically, reducing vehicle capacity frequently led to model infeasibility, indicating a critical threshold for maintaining feasible solutions. Increases in customer demand also resulted in substantial cost increases, although the model remained feasible in most cases. Increasing the number of vehicles did not significantly impact the cost, suggesting that the initial number of vehicles was sufficient for the demand levels tested.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity Reductions:** This parameter had the most significant impact, frequently leading to model infeasibility when reduced below certain thresholds (e.g., from 50 to 30, 20, 15, 10, and 5).
   
2. **Customer Demand Increases:** Increasing demand at specific customer locations often resulted in notable cost increases, with some scenarios leading to infeasibility (e.g., customer 7 and customer 5 in certain cases).

3. **Vehicle Capacity Increases:** Increasing vehicle capacity from 50 to 70 resulted in a cost decrease, indicating some sensitivity but less critical than reductions.

4. **Number of Vehicles:** Increasing the number of vehicles from 2 to 4 had no impact on cost, suggesting low sensitivity in this context.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 4, 5, 6, 8, 13, 16, 18, 20:** These scenarios, involving reductions in vehicle capacity or significant demand increases, led to model infeasibility, highlighting critical thresholds for maintaining feasible solutions.

- **Scenario 9:** Increasing the demand of customer 6 from 3 to 30 resulted in the largest cost increase (ΔObj: 99.24, 30.1%), making it a particularly revealing scenario for understanding the impact of demand changes.

- **Scenario 19:** Increasing vehicle capacity from 50 to 70 resulted in a cost decrease (ΔObj: -33.84, -10.3%), demonstrating the potential benefits of increased capacity under certain conditions.
