--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Capacitated Facility Location Problem (CFLP) model reveals that changes in facility capacities and fixed costs have the most significant impact on the total cost. Specifically, reducing facility capacities, either across all facilities or selectively, leads to substantial cost increases. Increasing fixed costs also results in a notable rise in total cost. In contrast, increasing customer demands and transportation costs have a moderate impact on the total cost. Importantly, none of the scenarios tested resulted in model infeasibility, indicating that the model is robust to the changes tested within the given parameter ranges.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Facility Capacities:** 
   - Decreasing capacities of all facilities by 50% resulted in the highest cost increase (ΔObj: 43.8%).
   - Decreasing capacities of specific high-capacity facilities had no cost impact, suggesting selective capacity reductions can be less impactful.

2. **Fixed Costs:**
   - Increasing fixed costs by 25% led to a significant cost increase (ΔObj: 21.2%).

3. **Transportation Costs:**
   - Increasing transportation costs by 50% resulted in a moderate cost increase (ΔObj: 7.7%).

4. **Demand Levels:**
   - Increasing customer demands by 50% led to a smaller cost increase (ΔObj: 4.9%).

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 3:** Decreasing the capacities of all facilities by 50% was the most critical scenario, causing the largest cost increase (ΔObj: 43.8%). This highlights the sensitivity of the model to overall capacity reductions.
- **Scenario 2:** Increasing fixed costs by 25% also had a significant impact, indicating the importance of managing fixed costs in the facility location problem.

Overall, the analysis suggests that capacity constraints and fixed costs are critical parameters in the CFLP model, with changes to these parameters leading to the most substantial impacts on total cost.
