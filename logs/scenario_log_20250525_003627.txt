--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The scenarios tested in the log focus exclusively on limiting the capacities of various facilities. All scenarios resulted in an optimal solution, indicating that the model remained feasible despite the imposed capacity constraints. The changes in facility capacities consistently led to significant increases in total cost, with percentage increases ranging from 19.1% to 19.9%. This suggests that facility capacity is a critical parameter in the model, with reductions in capacity leading to substantial cost increases.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Facility Capacities:** The only parameter type tested in the scenarios was facility capacities. All scenarios involving capacity limitations resulted in significant cost increases, highlighting the sensitivity of the model to changes in this parameter. The impact on cost was consistent across different facilities, with percentage increases in the objective function ranging from 19.1% to 19.9%.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1:** 'Limit the capacity of facility 5 (index 4) to 50.' This scenario resulted in the largest cost increase (ΔObj: 72.9, 19.9%), making it the most impactful change in terms of cost among the scenarios tested. This suggests that facility 5 may play a particularly crucial role in the network, and its capacity is a critical factor in maintaining cost efficiency.

Overall, the analysis indicates that facility capacities are a highly sensitive parameter in the CFLP model, with reductions leading to significant cost increases. No scenarios led to infeasibility, suggesting that the model is robust to the tested capacity constraints.
