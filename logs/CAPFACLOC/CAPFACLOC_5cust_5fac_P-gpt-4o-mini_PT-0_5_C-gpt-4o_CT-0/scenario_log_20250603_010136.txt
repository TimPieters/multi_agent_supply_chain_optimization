--- Final Analysis Summary ---
### 1. Summarize Key Findings:

The sensitivity analysis of the Capacitated Facility Location Problem (CFLP) model reveals that changes in facility capacities generally have a limited impact on the total cost, with most scenarios resulting in no change in the objective function (ΔObj = 0.0%). However, specific capacity limitations on facility 3 (index 2) led to a noticeable increase in total cost (ΔObj = 10.0, 4.5%). No scenarios resulted in infeasibility, indicating that the model is robust to the tested capacity changes.

### 2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:

1. **Facility Capacities (Specific to Facility 3, index 2):** Limiting the capacity of facility 3 to 50 or 40 resulted in a 4.5% increase in total cost, making it the most impactful change observed in the scenarios.
2. **Other Facility Capacities:** Changes to the capacities of other facilities (indices 0, 1, 3, 4) did not affect the total cost, indicating lower sensitivity to these parameters.

### 3. Identify Critical Scenarios:

- **Scenario 4 and Scenario 7:** Both scenarios involved limiting the capacity of facility 3 (index 2) and resulted in a cost increase of 10.0 (4.5%). These scenarios are critical as they highlight the sensitivity of the model to capacity changes at this specific facility, suggesting that facility 3 plays a crucial role in maintaining cost efficiency.

Overall, the analysis suggests that while most capacity changes do not impact the model's cost, facility 3's capacity is a critical factor in the cost structure of the supply chain.
