--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The scenarios tested in the log focus exclusively on limiting the capacities of various facilities. All scenarios resulted in an optimal solution, indicating that the model remained feasible despite the imposed capacity constraints. The changes in facility capacities consistently led to significant increases in total cost, with percentage increases ranging from 19.1% to 19.9%. This suggests that facility capacity is a sensitive parameter in the model, with reductions in capacity leading to notable cost increases.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Facility Capacities:** The only parameter type tested in the scenarios was facility capacities. All scenarios involving capacity limitations resulted in substantial cost increases, highlighting the sensitivity of the model to changes in this parameter. The impact on cost ranged from 19.1% to 19.9%, indicating a consistent and significant effect.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1:** 'Limit the capacity of facility 5 (index 4) to 40.' This scenario resulted in the largest percentage increase in cost (19.9%), making it the most impactful change among the scenarios tested. It highlights facility 5 as a critical point of sensitivity in the model.

Overall, the analysis indicates that facility capacities are a critical factor in the model's cost structure, with reductions in capacity leading to significant increases in total cost. No scenarios led to infeasibility, suggesting that the model is robust to the tested capacity constraints within the given limits.
