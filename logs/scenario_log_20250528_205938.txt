--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals that changes in vehicle capacity and customer demand levels have significant impacts on the total cost. Specifically, reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 resulted in a notable increase in total cost, indicating that vehicle capacity is a critical factor in maintaining cost efficiency. On the other hand, increasing the number of vehicles did not affect the cost, suggesting that the current number of vehicles was already sufficient to handle the demand efficiently. Changes in individual customer demands had varying impacts, with some increases leading to moderate cost changes, while others had no effect on the total cost.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Vehicle Capacity:** Reducing vehicle capacity had the most significant impact on cost, with a 26.3% increase in total cost, highlighting its critical role in the model's efficiency.
2. **Demand Levels:** Changes in customer demand levels showed varying impacts. Increasing the demand of customer 8 led to a 12.8% increase in cost, indicating sensitivity to demand changes at certain customer locations.
3. **Number of Vehicles:** Increasing the number of vehicles from 2 to 4 had no impact on cost, suggesting that the model was not constrained by the number of vehicles under the tested scenarios.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1:** 'Reduce the vehicle capacity from 50 to 30' was particularly revealing as it caused the largest cost increase (26.3%), demonstrating the sensitivity of the model to vehicle capacity constraints.
- **Scenario 5:** 'Increase the demand of customer 8 from 7 to 50' resulted in a 12.8% increase in cost, highlighting the impact of significant demand increases at specific customer locations.

These scenarios underscore the importance of maintaining adequate vehicle capacity and managing demand levels to optimize costs effectively.
