--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals several insights:

- **Vehicle Capacity Reduction:** Decreasing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 resulted in a significant increase in total cost, indicating that vehicle capacity is a critical factor in maintaining cost efficiency. However, the model remained feasible, suggesting some flexibility in capacity constraints.
  
- **Increase in Number of Vehicles:** Increasing the number of vehicles from 2 to 5 led to the lowest total cost among the scenarios, highlighting that having more vehicles available can significantly enhance cost efficiency and feasibility in meeting customer demands.

- **Demand Increases:** Various scenarios tested increased customer demands, which consistently resulted in higher total costs. However, none of these scenarios led to infeasibility, indicating that the model can accommodate demand fluctuations to a certain extent, albeit at a higher cost.

Overall, changes in vehicle capacity and the number of vehicles had the most pronounced impact on cost, while demand increases affected cost but did not compromise feasibility.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Number of Vehicles:** Increasing the number of vehicles had the most significant impact on reducing total cost, demonstrating high sensitivity to this parameter.
   
2. **Vehicle Capacity:** Reducing vehicle capacity significantly increased total cost, showing that capacity constraints are highly sensitive and critical for cost management.

3. **Demand Levels:** While increasing demand consistently raised costs, the impact was less pronounced compared to changes in vehicle capacity and number of vehicles. The model remained feasible under all demand increase scenarios.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 2:** Increasing the number of vehicles from 2 to 5 was particularly revealing as it resulted in the lowest total cost (330.1), demonstrating the substantial impact of vehicle availability on cost efficiency.

- **Scenario 1:** Decreasing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 led to a significant cost increase (416.89), highlighting the sensitivity of the model to capacity constraints.

These scenarios underscore the importance of vehicle-related parameters in optimizing the VRP model's cost and feasibility.
