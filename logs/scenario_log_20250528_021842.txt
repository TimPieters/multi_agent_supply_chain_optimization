--- Final Analysis Summary ---
**1. Summarize Key Findings:**

The sensitivity analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model reveals several key insights:

- **Demand Increases:** Increasing customer demand, whether at locations with high or low existing demand, consistently impacts the total cost. However, these changes did not lead to infeasibility, indicating that the model can handle demand fluctuations within the tested range.
  
- **Vehicle Capacity Reduction:** Reducing vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 did not cause infeasibility but increased the total cost, suggesting that the model can adapt to lower capacities, albeit at a higher cost.

- **Number of Vehicles:** Changes in the number of vehicles had a significant impact. Increasing the number of vehicles from 2 to 4 reduced costs, indicating improved routing efficiency and capacity handling. Conversely, reducing the number of vehicles from 2 to 1 led to infeasibility, highlighting the critical role of vehicle availability in maintaining model feasibility.

**2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:**

1. **Number of Vehicles:** This parameter had the most significant impact, with changes leading to both cost reductions and infeasibility. Increasing vehicles improved efficiency, while reducing them led to infeasibility.
   
2. **Demand Levels:** Changes in demand levels at customer locations affected costs but did not lead to infeasibility, indicating a moderate impact on the model's performance.

3. **Vehicle Capacity:** Reducing vehicle capacity increased costs but did not cause infeasibility, suggesting a lower impact compared to the number of vehicles.

**3. Identify Critical Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 4:** Reducing the number of available vehicles from 2 to 1 was particularly critical as it led to model infeasibility. This scenario underscores the importance of having a sufficient number of vehicles to meet customer demands.

- **Scenario 3:** Increasing the number of vehicles from 2 to 4 resulted in the largest cost reduction (from 416.89 to 330.1), highlighting the efficiency gains from optimal vehicle utilization.

These scenarios provide valuable insights into the model's sensitivity to changes in vehicle availability and demand levels, guiding strategic decisions in supply chain management.

--- Scenario Log ---
1. Scenario: 'Reduce the vehicle capacity from 50 to 30 to test for infeasibility and observe the impact on total cost due to increased demand on available vehicles.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 416.89
2. Scenario: 'Increase the demand at customer locations with the highest existing demand (customers 2, 4, and 10) by 50% to test the impact on total cost and potential infeasibility due to overloading vehicles.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 387.01
3. Scenario: 'Increase the number of vehicles from 2 to 4 to evaluate the effect on total cost and routing efficiency, potentially revealing insights on optimal vehicle utilization and capacity handling.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 330.1
4. Scenario: 'Scenario: 'Reduce the number of available vehicles from 2 to 1 to test for infeasibility due to increased demand on a single vehicle and observe the significant impact on total cost from longer routes and potential customer unserviceability.'' -> Error: Execution Result: Model Infeasible
5. Scenario: 'Increase the demand at customer locations with the lowest existing demand (customers 1, 5, and 8) by 100% to test the impact on total cost and potential infeasibility due to increased strain on vehicle capacity.' -> Status: Optimal, Cost: 382.11
