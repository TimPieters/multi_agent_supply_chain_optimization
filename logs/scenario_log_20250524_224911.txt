--- Final Analysis Summary ---
### 1. Summarize Key Findings:

The scenarios tested in the log focus exclusively on limiting the capacities of various facilities. All scenarios resulted in an optimal solution, indicating that the model remained feasible despite the imposed capacity constraints. The changes in facility capacities consistently led to significant increases in total cost, with percentage increases ranging from 19.1% to 19.9%. This suggests that facility capacity is a critical parameter in the model, with reductions in capacity leading to substantial cost increases.

### 2. Rank Parameter/Change Type Sensitivity:

1. **Facility Capacities:**
   - All scenarios involved limiting the capacities of different facilities, and each resulted in a significant increase in total cost (ΔObj % ranging from 19.1% to 19.9%).
   - No instances of infeasibility were observed, indicating that while capacity reductions significantly impact costs, they do not necessarily lead to infeasibility within the tested range.

### 3. Identify Critical Scenarios:

- **Scenario 1: 'Limit the capacity of facility 5 (index 4) to 50.'**
  - This scenario resulted in the highest cost increase (ΔObj: 72.9, 19.9%), making it the most impactful in terms of cost change.
  - It highlights facility 5 as particularly sensitive to capacity reductions, suggesting its critical role in the network's cost structure.

Overall, the analysis indicates that facility capacity is a highly sensitive parameter in the CFLP model, with reductions leading to significant cost increases but not causing infeasibility within the tested scenarios.
